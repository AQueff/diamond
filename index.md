[Diamond open access](/oa-models) journals are free to read and free to publish in, and are therefore the most equitable venues to publish your work.

Most diamond open access journals are collectively owned and operated by the academic communities they serve, avoiding the unethical practices of the big commercial scientific publishers.
Though the term is relatively new, many 'diamond' journals have been around for a long time â€“ quietly sustained by individual academic institutions or societies.

This community-maintained list of diamond open access journals in archaeology is meant to showcase and encourage broader support for these initiatives.
