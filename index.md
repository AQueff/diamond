[Diamond open access](/oa-models) journals are free to read and free to publish in.

They are the best way to publish your work in archaeology if you want it to be disseminated as widely and equitably as possible.
Most diamond open access journals are collectively owned and operated by the academic communities they serve, avoiding the unethical practices of the big commercial scientific publishers.
Though the term is relatively new, many 'diamond' journals have been around for a long time â€“ quietly sustained by individual academic institutions or societies.

This is a community-maintained list of diamond open access journals in archaeology.
