# Diamond Open Archaeology
This is a collection diamond open access archaeology journals.
Diamond journals are free to read and to publish in, and are therefore the most equitable venues to publish your work.

Most diamond open access journals are collectively owned and operated by the academic communities they serve, avoiding the unethical practices of the big commercial scientific publishers.
Though the term is relatively new, many ‘diamond’ journals have been around for a long time – quietly sustained by individual academic institutions or societies.
This resource exists to showcase and encourage broader support for these initiatives.

This is a community-maintained list.
See the [contributing guide](https://diamond.open-archaeo.info/contributing/) for information on how to add new records.

## Technical Stuff

3. Update gem dependencies with `bundle install`
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
